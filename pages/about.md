This wiki is a guide to the story world of The Dirt & The Water.

You'll find descriptions of The Dirt & The Water's [people](/people), [places](/places), [events](/events), [animals](/fauna), [plants](/flora), and more.

Reading the wiki might be fun, but it's really more of a repository for ideas, a public notebook for building the world that exists in the stories of Eika & Fullerton, The Dee Bugs, and others.

Right now this wiki is edited only by one person. Some day the ability to make changes to the wiki will be given to others. There will still be one person with the duty of deciding what changes are canon, but it would be exciting to see a community form around these fictional characters and cultures. To have a group of creators that all pull from this story world in their work would be some serious fun â€“ for both creators and readers.
