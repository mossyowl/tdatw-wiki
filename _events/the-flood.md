[Old Moncton](/places/old-moncton) flooded many years ago.

It was a town in a small valley between two mountains. On the other side of one mountain there was a river. When the residents of Old Moncton created a dam, the water seeped through the mountain, and flooded the valley. Old Moncton gradually became completely covered by water. Sometimes people dive and explore the town in their scuba suits.
